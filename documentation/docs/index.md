## What can MatchZy do?
MatchZy can solve a lot of match management requirements. It provides basic commands like `!ready`, `!unready`, `!pause`, `!unpause`, `!tac`, `!stop`, etc, provides matches stats, and much more!

**Feature Highligts:**

* Pug mode with simple commands to manage!
* Support of [Get5 Panel!](./get5.md)
